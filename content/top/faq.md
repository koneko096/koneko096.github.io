- **What is the answer of life, universe, and everythings?**

    42

- **Can we travel to the past?**

	According to some scientists, time is an illusion. There is no "past" or "future". They argue based on several experiments both on quantum physics and relativity, evidences showed there is no way to measure events order exactly. The only remained are events which correlated each other or have causal effect. So, (at least for now) there's no way we can go back to the past since it will violate causal order.   

- **Can you repair my computer?**

	No

- **Can you hack my fiancee Whatsapp account? I think he's cheating**

	Unfortunately no. Otherwise I still have to say no because of privacy.

- **I think it's good to have an app/website/softwareX for my company. Are you interested?**

	My past experiences discourage me to make it. And yet until it proven otherwise, better to say no to [such request](https://www.techinasia.com/talk/enterprise-software-hardest-software).
