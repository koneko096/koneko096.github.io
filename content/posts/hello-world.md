Hi again! It's been a while (again) since I wrote some of my thoughts online. Honestly, I don't want to move my posts from blogger. But, since my blogger layout apparently outdated (because of the old layout from the high school), I think I need to archive that old posts. Also, seems that easier to maintain a "plain HTML blog" rather than creating a wordpress or blogger layout. So, here we are, the new (github) blog.

Basically, I want to write more about technical stuffs here and throw the others at the medium (and another secret place of course nyahaha). So, feel free to bring any questions or suggestions by pinging me at twitter [@ical_fikr](https://twitter.com/ical_fikr), adding an issue or just drop me an [email](mailto:afrizalf96@gmail.com).

One more note, English is not my first language and still have a lot to improve. Please don't be too hard to me :sweat_smile:.
